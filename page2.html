       a talent that most people have in their everyday life.</h1>

       <h2>
        I have played, and am still playing, all sorts of instruments like the <br>
        trumpet. The trumpet is a nice brass instrument that requires a <br>
        very nice set of lungs.

       <h2>
        The French Horn is another nice instrument to start out with. <br>
        Taking less lung capacity to play, the french horn is an excellent <br>
        choice to have a child start playing. I have been playing this since <br>
        seventh grade.

       <h2>
        I also play the guitar, among many other instruments. The guitar <br>
        is a relatively light instrument that has a very nice sound when being played. <br>
        Unlike the violin, the guitar doesn't need a bow string to be played. You can use <br>
        a guitar pick or even just your fingers. Just make sure your hands are clean if you do.
