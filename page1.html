        <p>
            I don't mean to brag, but I think I am pretty good at problem solving. <br>
            puzzle games that require problem solving are the games that I am best <br>
            at and keep me the most entertained.

        <p>
          The Rubiks Cube is one way that a person can show how good <br>
        they are at problem solving. How fast they can do it shows <br>
        how good they are at memorizing different things. I can solve <br>
        a rubiks cube in just about a minute.

        <p>
            A puzzle is another good way to test someone's problem solving skills. <br>
            If someone likes a puzzle, they like testing their brain on what the picture <br>
            looks like and then piecing it together.

        <p>
            Sudoku is another way to tell if someone likes problem solving. <br>
            I don't know why, the internet said it does and apparently the <br>
            internet doesn't lie to anyone... Nope... Never.
