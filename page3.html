    <h1>
        As said on the <a href="index.html">HomePage</a>, I am around 17 years old <br>
        and am going to be graduating high school in a little <br>
        while. A hobby that I do in spare time, <br> (which I don't have that much of anymore) <br>
        is video games. Other times I hang out with neighbors and have a blast.

        This is one of the things that I like to do in free or spare time.

        I like to think that I am usually a regular person when it comes to programming. <br>
        However, some of the time I get lost in work and lose track of time because I <br>
        find it absolutely fascinating. The way programming lets you see what you are <br>
        creating in real time. This is something that I would love to do more often. <br>
        However, I am still only in high school and have to stick to a schedule of <br>
        several different classes.
