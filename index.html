       <h2>This is me: <br>
           I am a 17 year old who is just about to graduate from high school. <br>
           When I am on the clock I can get a lot of different things done <br>
           fast. I like to be on time as I plan to be everyday, although <br>
           some days I will run a little late and I apologise in advance for <br>
           that. I am graduating Wasatch High School as of 2023 during may. <br>
